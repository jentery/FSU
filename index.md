# From Lab to Classroom: Live Methods and Prototyping in the Arts and Humanities

Jentery Sayers | University of Victoria | [Department of English](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/) | [MLab in the Humanities](http://maker.uvic.ca/) | on the traditional territory of the Lkwungen-speaking peoples and the Songhees, Esquimalt, and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day

## This story begins with a lab.

The Maker Lab in the Humanities (MLab) opened in September 2012. The premise was to combine university lab cultures (especially in the arts and humanities) with a [makerspace](http://maker.uvic.ca/makerspace/) model, stressing experimentation, prototoyping, speculation, and histories of DIY craft and community-building. Models included Sandy Stone's [ACTLab](https://actlab.us/index.shtml) at UT-Austin and Beth Coleman and Marcel O'Gorman's [Critical Media Lab](http://criticalmedia.uwaterloo.ca/crimelab/) at Waterloo. 

We wanted to perform media theories and conjecture about media histories. Tara McPherson: "With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment about technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge in and through our objects of study" [(2009)](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/257016/). Kari Kraus: "We might, for starters, imagine conjecture as a knowledge toolkit designed to perform "what if" analyses across a range of texts" [(2009)](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000069/000069.html). Daniela K. Rosner: "I argue for a mode of research through design that treats the design as social inquiry (hereafter referred to as design inquiry). This positions designed systems and processes as tools with which to examine social phenomena. Design becomes a means rather than an end" [(2015)](http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/march-april-2015/reshaping-the-limits-of-design-in-hci). Laurie Anderson: "I don't know all the circuitry, but I can do first aid" [(1981)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=6BDrAAAAMAAJ&q=battcock+art+of+performance&dq=battcock+art+of+performance&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUmv_60ILaAhVIwGMKHYMzBxAQ6AEIKTAA).

[PACTAC](http://pactac.net/) was our neighbor (downstairs from us at UVic) and influenced us in the best possible ways. 

## Grant proposals were written.

We received support from the Modernist Versions Project (for research and infrastructure), Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (for research), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (for infrastructure), and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund (for infrastructure). [Bill Turkel](https://williamjturkel.net/) joined us on the SSHRC grant. He practices history through physical computing and fabrication techniques, often in collaboration with other historians in Science and Technology Studies (STS): "New Old Things" [(2012)](http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2506), with Devon Elliott and Robert MacDougall, and "Doing History by Reverse Engineering Electronic Devices" [(2018)](https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/2068861), with Yana Boeva, Devon Elliott, Edward Jones-Imhotep, and Shezan Muhammedi, for instance.  

During the grant-writing years, we often used terms such as "enduring ephemeral" [(Chun 2008)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/595632), "reverse engineering" ([Balsamo 2011)](https://www.dukeupress.edu/designing-culture), "technological imagination" (also Balsamo), "entanglement" ([Barad 2007])(https://www.dukeupress.edu/meeting-the-universe-halfway), "situated knowledges [(Haraway 1988)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178066?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), "screen essentialism" [(Montfort 2004)](https://nickm.com/writing/essays/continuous_paper_mla.html) and [(Kirschenbaum 2008)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mechanisms), and "digital labor" [(Scholz 2013)](https://www.routledge.com/Digital-Labor-The-Internet-as-Playground-and-Factory/Scholz/p/book/9780415896955). 

Together, these terms pointed us away from the "workstation" model for labs work toward messier, embodied forms of trial and error. The research corresponded less with legacies of humanities computing (e.g., digitization and encoding) and digital humanities (e.g., corpus linguistics, data visualization, and macro-analysis) and more with experimental media. McPherson: "*in and through* our objects" (as distinct from objects *of* inquiry). 

## Researchers were given space and funding. 

With grant support, the lab and [its team](http://maker.uvic.ca/people/) grew, funding undergradute and graduate students across the Humanities and Fine Arts. The research was driven by researcher interests. We hosted [visiting speakers](http://maker.uvic.ca/kopas/), who gave talks and facilitated workshops. We co-authored and co-edited a few publications on topics such as [public humanities](http://maker.uvic.ca/nano/) and [multimodal composition](http://maker.uvic.ca/ijlm/). 

The [first two years](http://maker.uvic.ca/twoyears/) were really about determining what we wanted to do and what we could do. We weren't particularly interested in popular brands of making, but we were curious about how critique could unfold through materials and tinkering. We read Nicolas Collins's [*Hardware Hacking*](http://www.nicolascollins.com/texts/originalhackingmanual.pdf) and Matt Rato's ["Critical Making"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01972243.2011.583819?journalCode=utis20) found inspiration in work by [Tara Rodgers](http://www.analogtara.net/wp/), [Sara Hendren](https://ablersite.org/about/), [Hannah Perner-Wilson](http://highlowtech.org/publications/hannahMSthesis.pdf), and [Johanna Drucker and Bethany Nowviskie](http://digitalhumanities.org:3030/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-4-10). We said the lab was culture first, technology a close second. As researchers graduated and left the university, they continued with their work, shaped by the lab yet clearly material and inquiries of their own: the portfolios of [Danielle Morgan](https://www.daniellemorgan.org/), [Nina Belojevic](https://ninabelojevic.wordpress.com/), [Nicole Clouston](http://nicoleclouston.com/), [Tiffany Chan](http://thisistiffanychan.com/), and [Shaun Macpherson](http://maker.uvic.ca/author/shaun/),for instance.
