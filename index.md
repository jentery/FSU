# From Lab to Classroom: Live Methods and Prototyping in the Arts and Humanities

## This story begins with a lab.

The Maker Lab in the Humanities (MLab) opened in September 2012. The premise was to combine university lab cultures (especially in the arts and humanities) with a makerspace model, stressing experimentation, prototoyping, speculation, and histories of DIY craft and community-building. Models included Sandy Stone's [ACTLab](https://actlab.us/index.shtml) at UT-Austin and Beth Coleman and Marcel O'Gorman's [Critical Media Lab](http://criticalmedia.uwaterloo.ca/crimelab/) at Waterloo. 

We wanted to perform media theories and conjecture about media histories. Tara McPherson: "With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment about technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge in and through our objects of study" [(2009)](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/257016/). Kari Kraus: "We might, for starters, imagine conjecture as a knowledge toolkit designed to perform "what if" analyses across a range of texts" [(2009)](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000069/000069.html). Daniela K. Rosner: "I argue for a mode of research through design that treats the design as social inquiry (hereafter referred to as design inquiry). This positions designed systems and processes as tools with which to examine social phenomena. Design becomes a means rather than an end" [(2015)](http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/march-april-2015/reshaping-the-limits-of-design-in-hci). Laurie Anderson: "I don't know all the circuitry, but I can do first aid" [(1981)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=6BDrAAAAMAAJ&q=battcock+art+of+performance&dq=battcock+art+of+performance&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUmv_60ILaAhVIwGMKHYMzBxAQ6AEIKTAA). 

## Grant proposals were written.

We received support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (for research), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (for infrastructure), and the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund (for infrastructure). [Bill Turkel](https://williamjturkel.net/) joined us on the SSHRC grant.
